## üìú Overview

OpenMammoth Firewall (O.M. Firewall) is an , **iptables-based firewall** designed for Linux systems.  
It provides layered protection against network attacks, unauthorized access, and malicious traffic while preserving normal internet connectivity.

Features include:  
- SYN flood protection  
- Rate limiting  
- Port scan detection with logging  
- Advanced ICMP, UDP, and TCP packet protection  
- Tor detection and prevention  
- Logging of suspicious network activities  
- Anti-spoofing and anti-fragmentation rules  
- Enhanced SSH security  
- HTTP/HTTPS connection limiting

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### 1. Firewall Activation
- Full iptables protection  
- Loopback traffic allowance  
- Established connection protection  
- ICMP control with Ping-of-Death mitigation  
- TCP and UDP advanced protections  
- SYN flood and connection rate limiting  
- Port scan detection  
- TCP MSS clamping  

### 2. Firewall Logging
- Detailed logging for suspicious and invalid packets  
- Logs saved to `/var/log/openmammoth-firewall.log`  
- Optional logging enable/disable from menu  

### 3. Tor & VPN Detection
- Multi-layered Tor traffic detection:  
  - Tor API check (`check.torproject.org`)  
  - DNS leak detection  
  - Tor process & port detection  
  - Tun/Tap interface inspection  
  - Public IP Tor exit node check  
- Firewall will **not activate** if Tor traffic is detected  

### 4. Firewall Status Reporting
- Displays active rule count  
- Input policy verification  
- Checks SYN flood protection, rate limiting, mangle table rules, and connection tracking  
- Shows system memory and CPU usage  

### 5. User-friendly Interface
- Interactive menu  
- Color-coded status messages  
- Safe internet connection preservation

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Details

- **Default Policies:** INPUT & FORWARD ‚Üí DROP, OUTPUT ‚Üí ACCEPT  
- **Loopback Traffic:** Always allowed  
- **SSH Protection:** Rate limiting & brute-force prevention  
- **ICMP Protection:** Echo-request limits & dangerous ICMP types blocked  
- **UDP Protection:** Rate limiting & invalid packets blocked  
- **Anti-spoofing:** Blocks private/reserved IP ranges  
- **Port Scan Detection:** Logs and blocks port scans  
- **Tor Traffic Prevention:** Ensures firewall rules don‚Äôt interfere with anonymization networks

## üßæ Logging

- **Primary log file:** `/var/log/openmammoth-firewall.log`  
- **Optional kernel logs:** `/var/log/kern.log` or `/var/log/messages`  
- **Logs include:**  
  - Firewall activations/deactivations  
  - Detected Tor traffic  
  - Invalid packets  
  - Port scan attempts
